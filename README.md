# Campus-Hack 2021
## Our Bot- Meet our Weather Bot- Mausam!

## Getting Started:
###### We made a new bot through the discord developer portal, introduced it in our server and then wrote our code.

Our code is written in python.
To run our code, you must do the following installations:
## Installations:
######  pip install discord
######  pip install requests
######  pip install python-decouple
 
Once all the installations were done, we wrote the code and kept increasing the commands one by one and then finally debugged it and finalized it with the following commands.

## Commands:
######  mausam._bot.intro
######  mausam.location
######  forecast8days.location
######  forecast.datelocation
######  aqi.location 
######  val.aqi
######  alerts.location

Also, in this process, we took all the information needed for our bot from the following API's:
